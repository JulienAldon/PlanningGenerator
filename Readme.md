# Planning Generator for Epitech Intranet

## [WORK IN PROGRESS]

The purpose of the script is to generate planningS accordingly to data on epitech's intranet.

It fetches intranet modules and activities informations then display them in a humain readable format.

For now the format is xlsx only, creating an excel formated planning.

In a future time i'd like to add an ical format support.

# Usage
```
pipenv run python planningator.py
```
